        Welcome to the ... Quiz Creator! Here are the only rules you need to follow:<br/><br/>

All questions must be about movies.<br/>
Each question should have four possible answers, but only one of them is the right one.<br/>
Feel free to add photos to your questions, or skip them entirely. Itâ€™s your call!<br/><br/>

Get creative and have fun crafting your ultimate movie quiz!
